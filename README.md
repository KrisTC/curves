# Curve Rendering Demo

A simple demo of resampling an image along a curve using a GPU-based renderer.

More information about the maths used to generate the curves can be found in "Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications: A Programmer's Guide, Second Edition" by James M. Van Verth and Lars M. Bishop. See chapter 10 on interpolation.
